function [times,errors,iters]=bench_qap(ns)
% Benchmark the QAP with random digraph data.
%function [times,errors,iters]=bench_qap(ns)
% Input is ns, if ns is a vector, it is interpreted as
% a vector of digraph sizes.  Each digraph is ER with p=log(n)/n.
% The isomorphoric "challenge" digraph is generated by randomly permuted the generated
% random digraph.  Then sfw a Frank-Wolf algorithm )FW) for QAP is invoked
% allowing up to 30 interations to align the random graph to its permuted
% version.
% On return the run time is given in the vector times,
% the number of edges in the permuted digraph that disagree between the FW
% solution in the vector errors and finally the number of iterations of FW
% performed is given in iters.
% Alternatively,
%   if ns is a square matrix than two sets of experiments are done in the
% first set 10 random permuations of A are applied and up to 30 iteration
% of FW are used to try to find this permutation.
% In the second set of experiments the matrix A is quantized to be 0/1
% using spones(A). The random
% permuation is kept to be the same for the corresponding experiment 1
% trial.
% On return the three arguments times, errors, and iters will be as before
% except they will have two columns each one for the first experiment and
% one for the experiment with the entries of A set to 0 and 1.
